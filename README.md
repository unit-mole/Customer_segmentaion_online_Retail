# Customer_segmentaion_online_Retail

This repository contains the analysis of the "Online Retail" dataset using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. The dataset consists of information related to online retail transactions. <br>

### Dataset Overview: <br>
The dataset includes the following columns: <br>

1) InvoiceNo: Invoice number of the transaction. <br>
2) StockCode: Product code of the item. <br>
3) Description: Description of the product. <br>
4) Quantity: Quantity of items purchased. <br>
5) InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction. <br>
6) UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product. <br>
7) CustomerID: ID of the customer making the purchase. <br>
8) Country: Country where the customer is located. <br>

### RFM Analysis: <br>

RFM analysis is a technique to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It involves analyzing three key metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. <br>

### Results of RFM Analysis: <br>
1) Recency: Identifying the recent purchases to understand the most active customers. <br>
2) Frequency: Analyzing purchase frequency to determine how often customers make purchases. <br>
3) Monetary Value: Evaluating the total monetary value of purchases made by each customer. <br>

### K-Means Clustering: <br>

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for customer segmentation. It groups similar customers based on their purchasing patterns. <br>

### Results of K-Means Clustering: <br>
1) Determination of Clusters: Using the Elbow Method, we determined the optimal number of clusters for segmentation. <br>
2) Cluster Characteristics: Understanding the characteristics of each cluster, including purchase behavior and preferences. <br>
